ios-etsy-sdk
============
Very simple read-only (no OAUTH) library to connect to a few Etsy services.

http://www.etsy.com/developers has all information for Etsy developers.

cocoa-pods
============
If you are downloading this library, execute the following from the bootstrap directory:

    pod install

This should download AFNetworking and Kiwi. AFNetworking is used extensively in the project. Kiwi is simply used for unit testing the API calls.
